# PASC_MECFS

*This repository contains code developed by the TraCS Data Science Lab, which is part of the School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
This code has been modified from its original form to protect proprietary information.*


## Code Source Environment Notes
The original version of this code was developed in the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative COVID Data Enclave, which runs on the Palantir Foundry platform. This code was developed in the Code Workbooks application within Foundry. Code Workbooks support mixing Python, R, and SQL code within a single workbook through a node-based GUI. The workflow of the code is also controlled through the node-based structure of the workbook. This user interface is specific to this environment; thus, code exported from this environment cannot accurately represent the code workflow built into the multi-language node structure. Instead, code is exported per workbook (folders in this repo) with all code aggregated into separate files by language. 


## Description
This repo makes the code available that was used for the analyses for a publication on PASC and ME/CFS. OSF is being used to mint a DOI for this code.  

The folders contain the original code used for the analyses reported in the publication. Each folder represents code from a different workbook in the code source environment. All code from a particular language is aggregated into a single file per workbook.  

The separate file, Model.ipynb, is a code file curated for sharing purposes that organizes and explains the logical flow of much of the code involved in the main modeling steps.
